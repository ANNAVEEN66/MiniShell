# MiniShell
MiniShell is a simplified version of a command-line shell (like Bash or Zsh). It allows users to execute commands, manage processes, and interact with the operating system through a text-based interface. This project demonstrates how shells work internally and helps in learning system calls, process management, and string parsing in C.
